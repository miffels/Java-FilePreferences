Java-FilePreferences
====================

Java Preferences with a backing file instead of the default store - original by David Croft (Public Domain)

The original publication can be found [here](http://www.davidc.net/programming/java/java-preferences-using-file-backing-store). I discovered some minor issues with this original source code and would have liked to contact him personally, but unfortunately the blog appears to be discontinued and registration is required for posting comments. You may find the original version in the first code commit, everything else are minor bugfixes from my side.

Just as the original version, this project is Public Domain. Attribution is appreciated, but not required.
